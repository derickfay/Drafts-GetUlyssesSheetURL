# Drafts-GetUlyssesSheetURL
Workflows and Drafts Action to search and copy URLs for Ulysses sheets

This is the iOS equivalent of [Alfred-GetUlyssesSheetURL](https://github.com/derickfay/Alfred-GetUlyssesSheetURL), but because there's no way to run an Alfred-style script filter in iOS, it instead:
1. requires the user to periodically run a Workflow workflow to update an index of Ulysses titles and URLs
2. uses a prompt within Drafts to select which links to copy

## Installation
1. Install [Update Ulysses URL Index](https://workflow.is/workflows/59cbeb1056ee490da6f356098168759d) in Workflow
2. Install [ProcessAllGroups for index](https://workflow.is/workflows/4ea1a8ee9cfa47c4b8d51ab07bdb95da) in Workflow
3. Install

Like Alfred-GetUlyssesSheetURL, it owes a lot to [UlyssesReportAndMarkdown](https://github.com/rovest/UlyssesReportAndMarkdown).
